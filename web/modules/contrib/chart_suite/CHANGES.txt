@par 9/19/2016, Version 0.1.0
Initial internal release.


@par 10/6/2017, Version 0.1.1
Internal release.

Bugs fixed:
  - File extension incorrectly taken from file path, not user-visible file
    name. This is important for FolderShare, which does not leave the
    extension on the path.
  - JS did not use strict mode and thus allowed use of undefined variables.

Administrative:
  - Renamed classes from "small-data*" to "smalldata*".
  - Reformatted PHP and JS code per Drupal coding conventions.
  - Passed PHP coding convention tests.
  - Added namespace documentation.
  - Updated file and class documentation.
  - Updated README.txt.
  - Updated JS documentation.
  - Updated YML documentation.
  - Renamed JS functions per coding conventions.
  - Moved help and theme hooks from .module file to .inc files.


@par 10/9/2017, Version 0.1.2
Internal release.

Bugs fixed:
  - Fixed typos in smalldata.js that prevent tree plots and some table plots.

New features:
  - Field formatter configuration options added:
    - Enable/disable including link to file.
    - Enable/disable showing anything if the file format is not recognized.
      This makes the formatter compatible with the "fallback formatter"
      contrib module which switches to the next formatter if the output of
      one is empty.


@par 6/19/2018, Version 0.2.0
Internal release.
